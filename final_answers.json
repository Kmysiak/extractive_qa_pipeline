If the Company requires that you work overtime, we will give you as much advance notice as possible.  You should not work overtime hours without prior approval by your immediate supervisor or the designated manager.  Under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act, time spent doing work not requested by the employer, but still allowed, is generally “hours worked” entitling employees to compensation, since the employer knows or has reason to believe that the employees are continuing to work and the employer is benefiting from the work being done. Employers should be especially careful when it comes to allowing non-exempt employees to read and respond to work-related emails after hours through the use of smart phones or similar devices. Remember, it is the employer's responsibility to exercise control and see that work it does not want performed is not done. Merely making a rule against “off the clock” work is not enough. The employer has the power to enforce the rule and must make every effort to do so.  Although you may voluntarily pay overtime compensation to exempt employees, you are not required to do so under federal law. Non-exempt employees are entitled to overtime pay.  Check your state laws as well, as they may impact both overtime compensation and minimum wages. As noted previously, we recommend separate handbooks for exempt and non-exempt employees to eliminate the need to call to employees’ attentions the variables in benefits and policies applicable to different groups of employees. If your company operates on a 24-hour a day, 7-day a week schedule, you may have separate compensation and overtime practices consistent with applicable law. In some instances, (healthcare) an employer may pay overtime for time worked in excess of 80 hours in two weeks rather than 40 hours in one week, subject to employee consent.",

Please keep in mind, however, that the Company is a professional business office, where clients and others often visit. Generally, clean, neat clothing is acceptable. However, torn jeans or other torn clothing and tee shirts with inappropriate verbiage or pictures are not appropriate casual attire. As always, please use common sense in your choice of business attire. It is the intent of this policy to comply with applicable state, local and federal laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of color, race, religion, sex (including pregnancy, sexual orientation and gender identity), national origin, disability, age, genetic information and any other status protected under such laws.  In some industries, jeans or shorts and tee shirts are the norm, while in others, shirts, ties, and business suits for men and women are the norm. Give careful thought in designing your policy. On the one hand, you want employees to be dressed appropriately, particularly if they interact with customers or clients. On the other hand, too many restrictions may cause unnecessary employee resentment. “Dress-down” or “casual” Fridays are one common option for companies where business attire is normally required.",

Vacation time is coordinated so that sufficient staff is available to provide adequate coverage at all times, and there may be Company-wide or department-specific “blackout dates,” as necessary. Vacation requests are granted on a first-come, first-served basis. In the event of a conflict in vacation requests, your supervisor will consider the Company’s staffing needs during the relevant period, as well as the length of service with the Company of the employees involved. Vacation Options: There are innumerable variables regarding vacation. You may wish to specify that employees earn so many hours or days of vacation each month or each pay period, and prohibit use of vacation not yet accrued.  The vacation time suggested here is a minimum. There is much to be said for giving employees three to four weeks of vacation early on in their job tenure, allowing them to go perhaps as high as six weeks if they are with you for many years. It is common for managers to earn more vacation than non-managerial employees. In fact, managers may often be able to negotiate variations in vacation time at the time of hire. It is wise to address benefits unique to managers in a separate handbook or in a supplement to this one. Some employers prefer to give employees a specified number of days annually to use for vacation, illness, personal needs, etc. Such a policy may reduce employee abuse of sick leave.  The downside of such a policy, however, is that sick employees may come to work in order to avoid losing vacation time and infect other employees. Similarly, an employee who suffers a serious injury or illness may have no time left for vacation.  ",

An employee who assumes the role of caring for a child is also entitled to receive parental rights to family leave, regardless of the legal or biological relationship. Either day-to-day care or financial support may establish a parental relationship when the employee intends to assume the responsibilities of a parent with regard to a child. The Human Resources Department will guide you in completing appropriate forms for the leave. Any paid leave that you have accrued may be counted as part of your FMLA leave.  To take FMLA leave, you must provide the Company with appropriate notice. If you know in advance that you will need FMLA leave, you must notify your supervisor or the HR Department at least 30 days in advance. If you learn of your need for leave less than 30 days in advance, you must give notice as soon as you can (generally either the day you learn of the need or the next work day). When you need FMLA leave unexpectedly (for example, if a family member is injured in an accident), you must inform your supervisor or the HR Department as soon as you can. ",
